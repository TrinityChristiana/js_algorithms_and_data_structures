Section 2: Big O Notation

## Objectives
- Motivate the need for something like Big O notations
- Describe what Big O Notatio is
- Simplify Big O epressions
- Define 'time complexity' and 'space complexity'
- Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using big O notation
- Describe what a lograithm is

## What is it
- ALlows us to compare different methods of getting a codng problem done by how efficient the solution is

## Who Cares?
- Its important to have a precise vocab to talk about how code performs
- good to discuss trade offs
- Helps to understand why code is slow
- It comes up in interviews
